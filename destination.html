      <h2>This Month's Destination: The White House</h2>

<p>Ask anyone who has taken a tour of the White House and they will likely tell you that it was one of the most memorable tours they have been on. There is so much to see: the architecture, the gardens, the decorations, and the art!</p>

<p>Recognizing that not everyone can afford a trip to our nation's capital, a team from Google recently created a virtual tour of the White House and included high resolution images of the artwork. Listen to some of the members who worked on the project:</p>

  <audio controls preload="metadata">
  <source src="whitehouse.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a <a href="whitehouse.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.</p>
  </audio>
  </div>
                                                                            
<p>And here is a video of Michelle Obama describing the virtual tour:</p>

      </video>

<p>Although this is a great resource to virtually explore the White House, there's still nothing quite like being there in person. By visiting our nation's capital, we can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of our nation and its fascinating history. Be sure to check out our monthly <a href="special.html">special page</a>, where trips to Washington DC begin at <s>$799</s> $699.</p>
